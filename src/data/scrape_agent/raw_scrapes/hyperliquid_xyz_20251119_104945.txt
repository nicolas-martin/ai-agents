The
Stack
Perps and spot order books are
two flagship applications built on
HyperCore. But they are
just the tip of the iceberg.
User-built applications on the HyperEVM
interact seamlessly with HyperCore
to let anyone use apps, launch tokens,
and trade, all in one place.
High performance applications are built
natively. These financial primitives on
HyperCore are accessible to user-built
applications on the general-purpose
HyperEVM, which supports familiar
Ethereum tooling. The HyperEVM and
HyperCore exist as one unified state,
unlocking applications that
simultaneously require performance,
liquidity, and programmability.
The foundation of the Hyperliquid
blockchain is HyperBFT consensus,
which lets a disparate set of nodes
agree on the state of the world. The
state comprises all applications,
both those built on HyperCore
and the HyperEVM.
